        "# Technical Documentation: An Agentic Pipeline for High-Accuracy Subtitle Generation\n",
        "\n",
        "#Objective\n",
        "This document outlines an agentic pipeline developed to generate accurate, speaker-separated subtitles for video clips. The pipeline demonstrates a multi-agent workflow where specialized AI models collaborate to perform complex media processing tasks, culminating in a high-quality, verified output.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Pipeline Stages:\n",
        "\n",
        "The pipeline is structured into the following stages:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Initialize Libraries and Download Dependencies**: This initial stage ensures that all necessary Python libraries (`yt-dlp`, `ffmpeg-python`, `openai-whisper`, `pyannote.audio`, `google-generativeai`, `sarvamai`, `pydub`) are installed in the environment. This is a foundational step to ensure the subsequent stages can execute without dependency errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Download Video and Extract Audio**: This stage handles the input video. It can accept a YouTube URL or a local video file. Using `yt-dlp`, the video is downloaded, and then `pydub` is used to extract the audio stream and convert it into a standardized WAV format (`assignment_audio.wav`). This ensures a consistent audio input for the downstream tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Transcribe Audio with Whisper**: The extracted audio is processed by the Whisper model (`openai-whisper`) to generate a complete transcription. This stage provides the textual content of the spoken dialogue along with word-level timestamps, which are crucial for aligning with speaker information later.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Perform Speaker Diarization with Pyannote**: In parallel with transcription, the `pyannote.audio` library is used to perform speaker diarization. This process identifies *who* is speaking and *when*. It segments the audio into speaker turns, labeling each segment with a speaker identifier (e.g., SPEAKER_00, SPEAKER_01). This output is essential for separating dialogue by speaker in the subtitles.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Generate SRT from Transcription and Diarization**: This is a critical integration stage. A custom function (`generate_srt_from_results`) takes the word-level timestamps and text from the Whisper transcription and the speaker turns from the Pyannote diarization. It aligns these two pieces of information to create a preliminary SRT file (`srt_output`) where each subtitle entry includes the text spoken, the corresponding timestamps, and the identified speaker.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  **Correct SRT with Gemini** : To achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, the draft SRT, the initial diarization timeline, and the original audio are passed to the Refinement Agent, powered by a large multimodal model (Gemini). This agent performs a holistic review, correcting any residual errors in timing, speaker assignment, or transcription, and generates the final, polished SRT file (`output.srt`).\n",
        "\n",
        "#Quality Check\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  **Burn Subtitles into Video**: Using FFmpeg, the corrected SRT file is embedded directly into the original video file. This creates a new video file (`final_video_with_subtitles.mp4`) with the subtitles permanently displayed, providing a visual output for review. (Human in loop)\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  **Quality Check the Subtitles with Gemini**: As a final quality assurance step, Gemini is used again to provide a confidence score and qualitative feedback on the final corrected SRT by comparing it against the original audio. This generates a report (`quality_report.csv`) detailing the accuracy of the transcription, speaker labels, and timestamps for each subtitle chunk.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  **Extract Initial Audio for Sarika (Optional)**: This stage demonstrates the potential to integrate other ASR services. A short segment of the audio is extracted to be sent to the Sarika model.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Transcribe with Sarika (Optional)**: Using the SarvamAI client and the Saarika model, the extracted audio segment is transcribed. This showcases how different transcription services can be incorporated into the pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Justification for Not Using a Specific Agentic Framework:\n",
        "\n",
        "While several excellent agentic frameworks exist (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex), this notebook intentionally utilizes simple Python functions and sequential execution within a Colab environment. This deliberate choice was made based on the following considerations, particularly relevant for demonstrating core engineering and problem-solving skills in an internship context:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Demonstrated Understanding of Fundamentals:** Building the pipeline from individual components showcases a deeper understanding of the underlying technologies (ASR, diarization, LLM integration) and how they interact. It highlights the ability to integrate disparate tools to solve a complex problem, rather than relying on a framework's pre-built abstractions.\n",
        "*   **Flexibility and Customization:** The modular nature of this approach allows for fine-grained control over each step. This is crucial for iterating on the pipeline, experimenting with different models or parameters, and addressing specific edge cases that might be difficult to handle within a more opinionated framework. For an internship, this demonstrates adaptability and a problem-solving mindset.\n",
        "*   **Efficiency and Reduced Overhead:** For a task of this scope and within the Colab environment, introducing a full-fledged agentic framework could add unnecessary complexity and overhead in terms of setup, learning curve, and potential debugging within the framework itself. A simpler, direct implementation is more efficient for demonstrating the core functionality.\n",
        "*   **Clear Data Flow and Debugging:** The sequential execution and explicit function calls make the data flow between stages transparent. This simplifies debugging and understanding where issues might arise in the pipeline, a valuable skill in any development role.\n",
        "*   **Focus on Core Logic:** By avoiding framework-specific boilerplate, the code directly focuses on the core logic of integrating the AI models and processing the data. This highlights the problem-solving approach and the implementation details of the subtitling pipeline itself.\n",
        "*   **Adaptability to Different Environments:** While demonstrated in Colab, the core logic and the use of standard libraries make this pipeline relatively portable and adaptable to different deployment environments, showcasing an understanding of practical software development considerations beyond a specific framework.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Conclusion and Future Work\n",
        "The implemented pipeline successfully meets the assignment's objectives, demonstrating an effective multi-agent workflow that produces high-quality, diarized subtitles.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Potential improvements and future work include:\n",
        "\n",
        "Alternative Architectures: Implementing a \"diarize-then-transcribe\" pipeline (where audio is first split into speaker chunks and then transcribed) as an alternative for comparison.\n",
        "\n",
        "Automated Error Flagging: Enhancing the QA Agent to automatically flag subtitles with low confidence scores for targeted human review.\n",
        "\n",
        "Model Benchmarking: Integrating other models (like the optional Sarika stage) more formally to benchmark their performance on key metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) against the baseline."
